# Coding Dojo Survey with Database
In this project I will be redoing an earlier assignment and improving upon it
by connecting the form submissions to a MySQL database, both for submissions and
to seed the drop down choices with possible options from the database ( for languages
and locations).

Skills used:
* Python
* MySQL
* Flask
* HTML
* Bootstrap styling
* Template inheritance
